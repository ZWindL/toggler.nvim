# Toggler.nvim
**TBD**

## Introduction
This plugin is inspired by the quick launcher of the status bar in KDE and Windows, on which you can press Super + Number to open a certain program.
On Neovim, there might be some frequently used plugins, like NeoTree, Telescope, etc., that you constantly toggle open and close, but don't want to memorize their keybindings.
Then `toggler.nvim` is the solution for you. A quick launcher indicates plugins and their corresponding number; you merely need to press Prefix + the number key.
Prefix can be `ALT`, `CTRL`, or `SUPER`.

### Features
1. Provides different options to display the quick launcher.
2. Configurations to customize keybindings.
    - Customize prefix key.
    - Customize plugin list.
3. (TODO) Create a dedicated UI element displaying the quick launcher.

## Installation and configuration
