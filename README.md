# Toggler.nvim

## Introduction
This plugin is inspired by quick launcher of the status bar in KDE and Windows, on which you can press Super + Number
to open a certain program. On Neovim, there might be some frequently used plugins, like NeoTree, Telescope, etc. that
you toggle them open and close constantly, but don't want to memorize their keybindings.
Then `Toggler.nvim` is the solution for you. A quick launcher indicates the plugin and its corresponding number, you
merely need to press Prefix + the number key, Prefix can be `ALT`, `CTRL` or `SUPER`.

### Goals
1. Provide some way to display the quick launcher.
2. Configuration to customize keybindings.
    - Customize prefix key.
    - Customize plugin list.
3. (nice to have) Create a new UI element to display the quick launcher.
